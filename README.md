# Project-Account Shuffler
# Day15 of 30 days 30 projects challenge

Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹ I put together this nifty web page to make juggling between accounts a breeze. No more head-scratching â€“ just smooth account swapping!

## What's in the Mix?
Card Center Stage: The main stuff hangs out in a card labeled "Accounts."

Profile Parade: Each account gets its own spot with a friendly face, name, and email.

Spot the Star: An indicator shows which account is the current superstar.

Add More Friends: Click "+Add account" to invite new pals to the party.

## How to Dive In:
1.Fire up the HTML file (AC.html) in your go-to browser.

2.Explore your existing accounts and sprinkle in new ones using the "+Add account" button.
